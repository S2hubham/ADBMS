Aggregation pipeline in MongoDB:

1. Aggregation Pipeline Overview:
   - The aggregation pipeline processes documents through multiple stages, transforming and combining data similar to Unix pipes.
   - Each stage in the pipeline performs an operation on input documents and passes the result to the next stage.

2. Basic Aggregation with `$group`:
   - `$group` is analogous to SQL's `GROUP BY`.
   - When using `$group`, you specify an `_id` field that indicates what field you are grouping by.
     - Example: 
       
       db.student.aggregate({ $group: { _id: '$gender', total: { $sum: 1 } } })
       
   - Here, documents are grouped by the `gender` field, and the `total` field counts the number of documents for each gender.

3. Using `$` for Field Reference:
   - The `$` symbol before a field name means that the value of this field from the input document will be substituted.
   - Example: `'_id': '$gender'` means `_id` will take the value of the `gender` field from each document.

4. Other Pipeline Operators:
   - `$match`: Filters documents to allow aggregation only on a matching subset (similar to `find`).
   - Example: 
     
     db.student.aggregate({ $match: { weight: { $lt: 600 } } })
     
   - `$sort`: Sorts the documents based on specified fields.
   - `$skip` and `$limit`: Skip a number of documents and limit the number of documents passed through the pipeline.

5. Combining Operators in a Pipeline:
   - You can combine multiple operators in a pipeline for complex transformations.
   - Example:
     
     db.student.aggregate(
       { $match: { weight: { $lt: 600 } } },
       { $group: { _id: '$gender', total: { $sum: 1 }, avgVamp: { $avg: '$vampires' } } },
       { $sort: { avgVamp: -1 } }
     )
     
   - This example filters documents by weight, groups them by gender, calculates the total count and average value for the `vampires` field, and then sorts the results by `avgVamp` in descending order.

6. Common Aggregation Expressions:
   - `$sum`: Calculates the sum of numeric values.
   - `$avg`: Calculates the average of numeric values.
   - `$min` and `$max`: Find the minimum and maximum values.
   - `$push`: Adds values to an array.
   - `$first` and `$last`: Return the first or last value for a group.



-Aggreagtion query
db.student.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$likes" },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$likes",  // Group by the liked item
      total: { $sum: 1 },  // Count the total number of occurrences
      students: { $addToSet: "$name" }  // Collect the names of students who like the item
    }
  },
  { $sort: { total: -1 } },  // Sort by the total count in descending order
  { $limit: 1 }  // Limit the result to the top 1 liked item
])
Explanation
$unwind: "$likes": Flattens the likes array so each like becomes a separate document entry.
$group: { _id: "$likes", ... }: Groups documents by the value of likes.
$addToSet: "$name": Collects unique student names who like the item.
$sort: { total: -1 }: Sorts the groups by total in descending order.
$limit: 1: Limits the output to a single document with the highest count.
Result
The output will tell you which food item is liked by the most students and provide a list of their names.

[
  { _id: 'Pizza', total: 3, students: [ 'Alice', 'Bob', 'David' ] },
  { _id: 'Sushi', total: 2, students: [ 'Bob', 'Charlie' ] },
  { _id: 'Pasta', total: 2, students: [ 'Alice', 'Charlie' ] },
  { _id: 'Burger', total: 2, students: [ 'Alice', 'David' ] },
  { _id: 'pizza', total: 1, students: [ 'shubh' ] },
  { _id: 'apple', total: 1, students: [ 'shubh' ] },
  { _id: 'cheese', total: 1, students: [ 'shubh' ] },
  { _id: 'mango', total: 1, students: [ 'shubh' ] }
]

Inclusion: Fields are included by setting them to 1 or true.
Exclusion: The _id field can be excluded by setting it to 0 or false.
Nested Fields: You can include fields from embedded documents using dot notation.
New Fields: You can create new fields or modify existing ones using expressions.

-Group
$addToSet -> Returns an array of unique expression values for each group. Order of the array elements is undefined.
$avg -> Returns an average for each group. Ignores non-numeric values.
$first -> Returns a value from the first document for each group. Order is only defined if the documents are in a defined order.
$last -> Returns a value from the last document for each group. Order is only defined if the documents are in a defined order.
$max -> Returns the highest expression value for each group.
$min -> Returns the lowest expression value for each group.
$push -> Returns an array of expression values for each group.
$sum -> Returns a sum for each group. Ignores non-numeric values.


NOTE : 
The $group stage has a limit of 100 megabytes of RAM.By default, if the stage exceeds this limit, $group will produce an error.





Here's a simple scenario to illustrate why the aggregation framework is often better than MapReduce and their differences:

Scenario:
Suppose you have an e-commerce database containing an orders collection with millions of documents, and you want to:

Calculate the total sales revenue (sum of all order amounts).
Group orders by customer ID to find out how much each customer spent.
Using the Aggregation Framework:
You can achieve this in one or two concise aggregation stages:

$group to sum up order amounts.
$project to refine output if necessary.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$customerId",
      totalSpent: { $sum: "$orderAmount" }
    }
  }
]);
Why it's better:

Faster and efficient: Runs natively in MongoDB without the overhead of JavaScript processing.
Optimized for performance: Takes advantage of MongoDB's built-in optimizations.
Using MapReduce:
To achieve the same result, you need to define both a map function (to emit key-value pairs) and a reduce function (to sum values):

map emits each order amount with the customerId.
reduce sums up all emitted values for each customer.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
db.orders.mapReduce(
  function() { emit(this.customerId, this.orderAmount); },
  function(key, values) { return Array.sum(values); },
  { out: "customer_totals" }
);
Limitations:

Slower: Runs JavaScript functions, which adds processing overhead.
Less efficient for simple tasks, especially in real-time use cases.
Conclusion:
Aggregation Framework: Better for most tasks due to speed, performance, and ease of use.
MapReduce: Useful when you need complex data processing or transformations not covered by aggregation but is generally slower and less suited for real-time needs.
